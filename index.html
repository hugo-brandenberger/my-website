			<h2>1. The birth of X News</h2>
			<p>X News is a weekly news project about extreme sports, led by the extreme sports association of IESEG called "X'trem". The idea of the project emerged around November thanks to Baptiste Darde, a former member of the communication department who became treasurer in January.
			Since February 3, 2023, the project has been launched and is promoted on the association's social networks, particularly on Instagram through weekly stories. The latter highlight news about various extreme sports and are available in a front page story dedicated to the project. This one appears on the Instragram page of X'trem.
			Thus, the X News are posted every week (more precisely every Friday at 5pm) by the members of the communication department of the association, who are Hugo Brandenberger (the manager), Elisabeth Desprez, Clarence Coeffic and Romain Proniewski.</p>
